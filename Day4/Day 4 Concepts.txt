Final
-----
used to restrict the user
1.variable-Constant
2.class
3.method

Is final method inherited?
yes you can...but we cannot override it..

what is blank or uninitialized final variable?

class Student
{
int id;
String name;
final String PAN_CARD;
}


class Car
{
final int speedLimit;
Car()
{
speedLimit=100;
}
}

can we declare constructor as final?
 NO

static blank final variable
-static final variable that is not initialized at the time of 
decalration ...it can be initialized only in static block

class Car
static final int speedLImit;
static{
speedLimit=40;
}
main()
{
sop(Car.speedLimit)
}

Method overloading
------------------
-if a class has multiple methods haveing same name but different
parameters 
a(int .int)
b(int,int,int)
-advantage is to increase readability of program

ways
---
1.by changing number of arguments
2.by changing data type

can we overload java main()?
--------------------------
-yes by method overloading


method overriding
-----------------
-if a child class has the same method as declared in parent class
-method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

differnce btw method overloading & method overriding
------------------------------------------------------

covariant return types
